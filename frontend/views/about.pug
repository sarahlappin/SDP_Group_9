      | What is eIEIO? 
      
    
    p(style="text-align: justify;")
      | eIEIO is a soil sampling system that allows an autonomous robot to travel around a given area 
      | taking various reading of soil characteristics. 
      | This service allows you to view the data and make informed decisions about your land.
      | Once a piece of land is set up then surveys can be requested as frequently as you desire. 
      | Visuals such as heat-maps and line graphs allow you spot areas of concern or emerging trends in your land. 
      | This also allows you to test whether changes you make to your land are being effective.

      | eIEIO allows our users to check various characteristics of land, such as CO and soil moisture,
      | and reflecting on these readings they can maintain better soil environment, which can assist them in maximizing plant growth or crop production.
      | For instance, some farmers are worried that chemicals from nearby factories would make their land acidic.
      | With eIEIO, they will figure out whether their land has become more acidic and by how much percentage, much sooner than without one.
      | Moreover, our users (mostly farmers and gardeners) can utilise eIEIO to find the best land for their purposes before purchasing or renting one.
